Description: Brotli compression/decompression library (development files)
 Brotli is a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm that compresses
 data using a combination of a modern variant of the LZ77 algorithm,
 Huffman coding and 2nd order context modeling, with a compression ratio
 comparable to the best currently available general-purpose compression methods.
 It is similar in speed with deflate but offers more dense compression.
 .
 This package contains the development files required to build programs
 against Brotli.
